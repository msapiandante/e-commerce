## Description

I was tasked with creating the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying provided starter code. My goal was to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I was able to complete modifying the models folder, a readme and server.js. I was not able to complete the routes folder in time for submission. I plan to resubmit once complete.
